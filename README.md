## About

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language.

I'll place here my personal solutions to the puzzles.

I'll explore GitHub Copilot for helping me to build, fix and optimize the code.
